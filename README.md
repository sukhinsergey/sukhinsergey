### Hello, I am Sergey ðŸ‘‹
Currently work as a project manager where I am responsible for smooth product development pipeline and performance improvements.
This drives me to expand in the sphere of data and product analytics where my passion is.
I mostly focus on:
- Data exploration
- Analysis of metrics in e-commerce
- A/B tests and hypothesis verification
